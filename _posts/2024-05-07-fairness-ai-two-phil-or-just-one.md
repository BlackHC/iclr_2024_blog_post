title: "Fairness in AI: two philosophies or just one?"
description: The topic of fairness in AI has garnered more attention over the last year, recently with the arrival of the EU's AI Act. This goal of achieving fairness in AI is often done in one of two ways, namely through counterfactual fairness or through group fairness. These research strands originate from two vastly differing ideologies. However, with the use of causal graphs, it is possible to show that they are related and even that satisfying a fairness group measure means satisfying counterfactual fairness.
