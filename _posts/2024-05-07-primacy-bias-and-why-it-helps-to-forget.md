title: It's Time to Move On: Primacy Bias and Why It Helps to Forget
description: "The Primacy Bias in Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Nikishin et al. 2022) demonstrates how the first experiences of a deep learning agent can unduly influence its future behaviours and how this can be mitigated. In this post we summarise the authors' key findings, present simple examples to build intuition, and discuss directions for future research.
